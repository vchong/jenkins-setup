TODO:
 - split out init and build steps into 2 scripts
 - make 'build' command parameterized too
 - remove .sh extension to all scripts, make them all +x, no longer assume bash
 - use set -e everywhere for better failure detection
 - support for building several images (and with proper buildhistory)
 - avoid repo sync for each build (for matrix based workspace)
 - better support of local vs Jenkins mode (not sure if it's working today)
 - remove hardcoded /mnt/ci_build instances
